# Simple Book Library

# Overview

This project is a simple book library system developed using Java. It is designed based on 
the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), utilizing concepts such as classes, 
objects, encapsulation, and methods. The project uses arrays to manage a collection of books, 
allowing users to perform essential library operations such as adding, borrowing, and returning books.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of OOP fundamentals 
and array data structures, making it a great learning resource for beginners in Java programming.
